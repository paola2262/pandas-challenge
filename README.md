## Data Description

This dataset contains data generated by Mockaroo, LLCLinks to an external site., (2022). Realistic Data Generator. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational 
purposes only.

This project analyzes standardized test results and school data for a city's school district to provide insights for decision-making regarding school budgets and priorities.

## Files Included

- Scores by School Type

## Results

* The analysis shows that schools have different levels of academic success, seen in math and reading scores, and passing rates.
After analyzing the results, it can be inferred that there is a positive correlation between per-student spending and academic performance.
When schools invest more resources per student, like increasing budgets and providing greater financial support, students tend to achieve 
better academic outcomes, this highlights the vital importance of having sufficient funding to provide the necessary resources and support
for enhancing student success in schools.

*Charter and district schools show varying levels of academic performance. Identifying the top-performing and underperforming schools helps
us understand what strategies are effective and what areas need improvement.

*Examining factors affecting results highlights the crucial role of data-driven decisions in education, ensuring fairness and equal opportunities
for all students to maximize their potential.
